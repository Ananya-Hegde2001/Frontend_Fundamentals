# Frontend Fundamentals

a small, quiet space where i’m practicing the basics — html, css, and javascript.

## what’s here
- `HTML_Essentials/` — tiny html examples
- `CSS_Essentials/` — a simple stylesheet i play with
- `JavaScript_Essentials/` — short scripts (arrays, loops, strings, etc.)

## how to try things
- open `HTML_Essentials/index.html` in your browser
- for js files, you can:
  - paste code into your browser console, or
  - run with node:
    - `node JavaScript_Essentials/array_sum.js`

## notes
- it’s minimal on purpose. the goal is clarity, not polish.
